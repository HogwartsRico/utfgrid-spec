# UTFGrid

UTFGrid is a specification for rasterized interaction data. As of version 1.2,
it was removed from incubation in the
[MBTiles Specification](https://github.com/mapbox/mbtiles-spec) and split into
its own repository.

See CHANGELOG.md for per-version changes.

## Examples

The [Visible Map demo](http://mapbox.com/demo/visiblemap/) is an example of
client-side interaction using UTFGrid encoded features.

[Glower](https://github.com/mapbox/glower) shows how to do feature highlighting.

Mapnik's [grid_renderer](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/tree/master/include/mapnik/grid)
is an example of code that can encode spatial features into UTFGrid.
